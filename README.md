# 📝 Degen – Open-Source Decentralized Notebook for Blockchain Analytics

Degen is an **open-source, decentralized** notebook for blockchain analytics. If you've used Dune, Nansen, or Glassnode, you know the value of on-chain data—but also the pain points: **closed ecosystems, centralized control, and restricted data access**.

Degen flips the model by giving **anyone** full control to **query, remix, and share** blockchain insights transparently.
